# Blockchain using Python
# Install Flask version 0.12.2 by using pip install Flask==0.12.2
# Install Postman HTTP client: https://www.getpostman.com/

# Importing libraries
import datetime  # since each block will have its own time
import hashlib  # to hash the block
import json  # encode the blocks before hashing
# Flask is used to create an object which will be the web-app
# jsonify is used to return the response of the requests
